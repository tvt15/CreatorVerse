## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.
I underestimated the time required for the task initially. Developing a web application presents significant challenges, particularly when managing multiple concurrent responsibilities.

## Future Scope:
- [ ]  **a Light-Dark theme toggle switch**
- [ ]  **Automatic profile picture parser**
